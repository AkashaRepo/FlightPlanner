FlightPlanner
=============
This is the Github Repository for Nsheppard and Weshney's Air Travel Planner java project.
All .java files should go in the src sub-folder. The files with periods in front of them (dotfiles) are Eclipse stuff, so please ignore them.

We can Use this README file to write notes to each other and discribe the project once it's in a more coherent state.
It uses Markdown formating. If you don't know what that is, don't worry, markdown is designed to be unobtrusive.
